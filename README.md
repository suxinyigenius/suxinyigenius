<h2>Here are some projects link üìñ </h2>
<h3><a href="https://suxinyigenius.github.io/Project%20A/">1. A Little Robot and His Tree Friend </a></h3>
-This project demonstrates a scene about a little robot and his tree friend. Basically, I use cubes and tetrahedrons to design. Each vertex has a different color.<br>
-The current angle of the robot and his tree friends can be displayed on canvas. Also, users can enter a new current angle to change the degree.<br>
-Users can use the mouse to click/drag the small house on the upper right of the canvas. Users can see the mouse coordinate and mouse drag as well.<br>
-The robot and his tree friend can keep spinning, users are able to use the keyboard to move them. For example, users can use WASD navigation and arrow keys to move them to go left, right, back, and FWD.<br>

<h3><a href="https://suxinyigenius.github.io/ProjectB/">2. Flying Through Little Robot and His Friends </a></h3>
-The goal of this project was to create a three dimensional world with a little robot, his tree friend, a snowman, and a torus that the viewer can explore. The world would have a ground plane that shapes would rest on, and the viewer could look at this world from two different viewports.<br>
-Upon opening the html file in the browser,there will be a set of basic instructions on how to alter objects on the screen and move the camera around the world space.The axes of the world are located and displayed at the origin,and part of the jointed platform also have their own 3D axes,which rotates with the attached object.<br>

<h3><a href="https://suxinyigenius.github.io/ProjectC/ProjectC/">3. Colorful Lighting Wolrd </a></h3>
-The goal of this project was to create a world the user can explore with different lighting/shading methods illuminating the shapes. The objects of the world would rest on a ground plane surface and each have individual normal that reflected the light from both a user-adjustable light source and a headlight attached to the camera. <br>
-Users are able to switch light on/off,shading methods,lighting methods,light poistions, and view positions.Alos, different materials are being used.

<h3><a href="https://suxinyigenius.github.io/tenzies/">4. Tenzies Dice Game created with React </a></h3>
-Create ten dice using React Hooks, each with a random number between one and six inclusive<br>
-Freeze all dice of the selected number as the current value and change the background color to highlight, continue to roll other dice until the dice are all the same value <br>
-End the game and use react-confetti to show congratulation style, then click the new game button to start a new game
